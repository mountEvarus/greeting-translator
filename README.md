# Greeting Translator

This app was created solely to practice Test Driven Development and all-around testing. I used Jest for unit tests and Cypress for UI testing. This project challenged me to seperate dom interaction from the functions, so that unit tests could be run properly.

## What was used

I used HTML, SCSS, Javascript, Jest and Cypress for this project.
